    "historyTitle": "My Journey",
    "history": "My career in software development began in 2009 when I immersed myself in the .NET universe and took my first steps in creating corporate systems. Since then, I have expanded my work to different technologies and contexts, always guided by the desire to learn and share knowledge.\n\nI have had the opportunity to work at renowned technology companies and consultancies, such as Venturus, Dextra, Avenue Code, and currently Codurance, collaborating on national and international projects. I have held different roles â€” from developer to tech lead â€” and have led initiatives that involved everything from modernizing legacy systems to building scalable web applications from scratch.\n\nIn addition to hands-on project experience, I have also worked as an instructor and mentor, providing internal and external training in technologies such as Angular, React, and Node.js. This experience has solidified not only my technical background but also my passion for helping others grow in the field.\n\nToday, as a Senior Frontend Engineer, I continue to combine experience, innovation, and best practices to transform ideas into impactful digital products, focusing on performance, usability, and design.",
